npm install this.pixelgrid
```

## Key Features

- **Fixed-Dimension Grids:** `this.pixelgrid` offers functionality to define grids of specific dimensions, ensuring uniformity across all processed images.
- **Image Capture & Loading:** Facilitates capturing images within the grid's boundaries and loading existing images into the grid for processing.
- **ECMAScript Module:** Designed as an ECMAScript module, `this.pixelgrid` integrates smoothly with modern JavaScript projects, ensuring easy import and export of its functionalities.

## Usage

Here's a basic example to get you started with `this.pixelgrid`:

```js
import pixelgrid from 'this.pixelgrid';

// Create a new PixelGrid instance
let myGrid = new pixelgrid.PixelGrid(640, 480);

// Load or capture an image (demonstration purposes)
myGrid.loadImage([...]);
myGrid.captureImage();
```
